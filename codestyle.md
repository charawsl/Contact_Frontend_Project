## Priority A Rules: Essential (Error Prevention)
### Multi-word component names

Component names should always be multi-word, except for root App components, and built-in components provided by Vue, such as <transition> or <component>.  

This prevents conflicts with existing and future HTML elements, since all HTML elements are a single word.
